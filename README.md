# MigrantWorkerSystem



we propose a "Migrant Worker System" where any migrant irrespective of their gender, race and state can enroll in the Migrant workers Portal in the locally available "Workers Privilege Centres(WPC's)".WPC's are central government owned locally administered state governing privately owned entities where migrant workers will enrol themselves with a primary proof upon their arrival in a foreign state. Upon the primary proof submission they are administered n filling the Migrant worker Security Form which will help them in getting a Migrant Worker Security Number  which will be used by the governments in providing benefits for those working labour.We design a system where data about migrant workers, government and private entities are stored in the form of Block Chains in the Migrant workers portal and the data will be transferred and administered by the government and private individuals with an End to End Encryption.Migrant workers visiting the local WPC are asked to submit a preliminary proof confirming their identity as a citizen of India upon which they are required to fill a form which helps to keep track of the migrant worker while he stays in any foreign state.The Migrant Database system stores the data which will be used by the governments, public and private agencies to provide worker benefits which will be set by the local state agencies and government.This will help the State Governments to have a database of migrant workers in their region while helping them by providing daily wages when they are on and off the work while providing a great deal of Safety,employment and security to migrant workers who are boosting the economy of the states.

With Migrant worker System, we will be able to provide an open platform for Government, public and private agencies to protect the rights of migrant workers while maintaining and keeping track of migrants in and out of their state while helping private agencies to hire labour legally.
